-- In this PostgreSQL code, I'm querying a database that's holding Nexflix data to answer questions about the data. 

-- Example query (PostgreSQL)
SELECT * FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people";

-- Example left join query of specific columns between two joined tables
SELECT people.show_id, people.director, titles.title, titles.type
    FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
    LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
    ON people.show_id = titles.show_id;

-- Example query to discover how many movie only titles are in the database
SELECT COUNT(type)
    FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" 
    WHERE type='Movie';

-- Example query to discover the dates of the most recent batch of TV shows and/or Movies added to the database
SELECT date_added
    FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" 
    WHERE date_added IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY date_added DESC
    LIMIT 20;

-- Example query to show all the movies and TV shows in alphabetical order
SELECT title
    FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
    ORDER BY title ASC;

--Example query to discover the director for the movie titled "Bright Star"
SELECT people.director, titles.title
    FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
    LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
    ON people.show_id = titles.show_id
    WHERE titles.title = 'Bright Star';

-- Example query to discover the oldest movie in the database and the year it was made
SELECT title, date_added, release_year
    FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
    WHERE type='Movie'
    AND date_added <=
