--HelpDesk Questions
--1. There are three issues that include the words "index" and "Oracle". Find the call_date for each of them

SELECT Call_date, call_ref FROM issue
WHERE detail like '%index%' AND detail like '%Oracle%';

--2. Samantha Hall made three calls on 2017-08-14. Show the date and time for each

SELECT call_date, first_name, last_name
FROM issue i
LEFT JOIN caller c
ON i.caller_id = c.caller_id
WHERE call_date = '2017-08-14'
AND (first_name = 'Samantha' AND last_name = 'Hall');

--3. There are 500 calls in the system (roughly). Write a query that shows the number that have each status.

SELECT status, COUNT(Call_ref)
FROM issue
GROUP BY status;

--4. Calls are not normally assigned to a manager but it does happen. How many calls have been assigned to staff who are at Manager Level?

SELECT COUNT(i.Call_ref) AS Manager
FROM Issue i
JOIN staff s
ON i.assigned_to = s.staff_code
JOIN level l
ON s.level_code = l.level_code
WHERE l.Manager = 'Y';

--5. Show the manager for each shift. Your output should include the shift date and type; also the first and last name of the manager.

SELECT Shift_date, Shift_type, first_name, last_name
FROM Shift sh
JOIN Staff st
ON sh.Manager = st.staff_code;

--6. List the Company name and the number of calls for those companies with more than 18 calls.

SELECT Cu.Company_name, COUNT(i.Call_ref)
FROM Issue i
JOIN Caller Ca
ON i.Caller_id = Ca.Caller_id
JOIN Customer Cu
ON Ca.Company_ref = Cu.Company_ref
GROUP BY Cu.Company_name
HAVING COUNT(i.Call_ref) > 18;

--7. Find the callers who have never made a call. Show first name and last name

SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name
FROM Caller c
LEFT JOIN Issue i
ON c.Caller_id = i.Caller_id
WHERE i.call_date IS NULL
OR i.call_date = '';

--8. For each customer show: Company name, contact name, number of calls where the number of calls is fewer than 5

WITH CTE AS (
SELECT Cu.Company_name, CONCAT(Ca.Last_name, ', ', Ca.First_name) AS Contact_Name, i.Call_ref 
FROM Issue i
JOIN Caller Ca
ON i.Caller_id = Ca.Caller_id
JOIN Customer Cu
ON Ca.Company_ref = Cu.Company_ref
)

SELECT Company_name, MIN(Contact_Name) AS Contact, COUNT(Call_ref) AS Call_Count
FROM CTE
GROUP BY Company_name
HAVING COUNT(Call_ref) < 5;

--9. For each shift show the number of staff assigned. Beware that some roles may be NULL and that he same person might have been assigned to multiple roles (The roles are 'Manager', 'Operator', 'Engineer1', 'Engineer2).

WITH Staff_Count_CTE AS (
SELECT Staff_code, Shift_date, Shift_Type
FROM Staff
JOIN Shift
ON Shift.Manager = Staff.Staff_code
UNION
SELECT Staff_code, Shift_date, Shift_Type
FROM Staff
JOIN Shift
ON Shift.Operator = Staff.Staff_code
UNION
SELECT Staff_code, Shift_date, Shift_Type
FROM Staff
JOIN Shift
ON Shift.Engineer1 = Staff.Staff_code
UNION
SELECT Staff_code, Shift_date, Shift_Type
FROM Staff
JOIN Shift
ON Shift.Engineer2 = Staff.Staff_code)

SELECT Shift_date, Shift_type,
COUNT(DISTINCT Staff_code) AS Crew_Level
FROM Staff_Count_CTE
GROUP BY Shift_date, Shift_type;

--10. Caller 'Harry' claims that the operator who took his most recent call was abusive and insulting. Find out who took the call (full name) and when.

SELECT i.Call_date, s.First_name, s.Last_name
FROM Caller c
JOIN Issue i
ON c.Caller_id = i.Caller_id
JOIN Staff s
ON i.Taken_by = s.Staff_code
WHERE c.First_name like '%Harry%'
ORDER BY i.Call_date DESC
LIMIT 1;
